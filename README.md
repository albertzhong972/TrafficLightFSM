# TrafficLightFSM
Traffic Light FSM for TM4C123G

This is Lab 10 for the EDX Embedded Systems course from UT Austin. In this lab, I designed and implemented a FSM
for a traffic light controller. 

To finish this lab, I needed to:

-Create a FSM that would make the traffic lights function as expected.

-Initialize GPIO in ports B, E, and F to use with external LEDs and button switches.

-Initialize and use SysTick Timer to create an accurate time delay.
